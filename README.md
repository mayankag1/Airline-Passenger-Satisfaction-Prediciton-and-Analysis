# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Prediciton-and-Analysis
In our analysis, we first perform exploratory data analysis to visualize our data to find some useful insights about our data. 
Then we look to find missing values and outliers in our data and handle them using appropriate methods.<br><br>
Feature selection is done using chi-square test and permutation test to select the top features to use for our classification models.
Feature engineering methods like label encoding and data normalization techniques are applied. We make use of six classification models in our
analysis: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest neighbors, Random Forests, Ada Boost and XGBoost. 
Analysis of these models is based on accuracy and AUC score. 
The factors that affect a passengerâ€™s satisfaction the most are determined by feature importance using the model giving us the highest accuracy.<br><br>
Some other techniques like visualization of decision trees and shap values are investigated to better understand how the 
classification models are predicting satisfaction classes.
